<h3>Sheffield Psychedelic Integration Group</h3>

Would like to invite you to our first

Integration Circle

Thursday November 3rd,

7.15 pm – 9.00 pm Broomhill, Sheffield.

 

Psychedelic experiences can be very powerful, and can open us up in all sorts of ways, some more easy to accept and live with than others. Some experiences can feel overwhelmingly positive, even taking us beyond our normal ego boundaries, and some can feel challenging because we confront difficult emotions or memories or they challenge our view of reality in an unsettling way.

 

The purpose of a psychedelic integration circle is to provide a space where anyone can open up and share about any psychedelic experience they have had, in a supportive, non-judgmental space.

What we are offering is first of all a place to simply to have your experience heard and witnessed. On top of this there will be the opportunity to get some perspective, get help with grounding and integrating the experience into the rest of your life, and, if you want to, to hear other people’s point of view on the experience.

 

Integration Circles are a well-recognised way of bringing the learning of a psychedelic experience into one’s life. Many users of psychedelics and therapists consider the integration of the experience to be more important than the experience itself

 

The circle will run on the first Thursday of each month and will be facilitated each time by two members of our team, who all have experience of psychedelics and psychedelic integration. Between us we will ensure that it is a safe and well held space.

We are asking for a £10 contribution to cover costs.

 

We will send more details about the format and group agreements, and the address etc. when you book.
