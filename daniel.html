<h3>Psychedelic therapy & healing</h3>
<br/>
<p>
  I would like to offer free healing/therapy sessions to group members to kickstart my practice. I have 30+ years experience with psychs and 3 diplomas in psychology. I’m currently studying a a course in shamanism but will be using the label psych therapist/healer instead - to avoid sounding pretentious or appropriating an indigenous culture that goes back thousands of years, but the premise is basically the same: using psychs to facilitate healing and work through traumas and other personal, relational and mental health issues. I will be combining this with some talk therapy and journey integration and approaching it scientifically, as well as ‘spiritually’. 
<br>
<br>
Some people are more skeptical by nature and don’t have time for woo, so I feel this needs to be accommodated for in psych healing sessions. Others prefer a more spiritual approach. I don’t think the two need necessarily be mutually exclusive. One can simply choose to look at the spiritual aspect as metaphor and symbolism if that suits you better. Belief and suspension of disbelief have proven benefits.
<br>
<br>
I have a few years experience organising group and solo journeys, with some quite successful results. I’ve helped people work through depression and addiction issues, in particular, although I do not promise miracles. You need to put in the work too - outside of the therapeutic setting. 
<br>
<br>
Each session will last 2-3 hours approximately. My time is free (for now). Please feel free to PM me for details.
